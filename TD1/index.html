                                <p>You have to give minimal space between divs, so that it's readable but still unpleasing. To make it painful, you have a lot of choice. I picked a very vertical layout that will please phone users but get hated on by computer people. Don't get me wrong, the main div is still a bit too large for all phone users to get a good experience and it's not responsive at all.</p>
                                <p>Also chose a variety of fonts that are totally readable yet either a bit stretched, or thin, maybe too small, and put it all in one place.</p>
